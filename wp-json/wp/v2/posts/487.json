It is built on Ledger\u2019s secure architecture and introduces a unique form designed for unprecedented accessibility and interactivity with the world of cryptocurrencies and NFTs.<\/p>\n<h3>ENTER THE NEXT GENERATION OF WEB3 DEVICES<\/h3>\n<p>Ledger has the world\u2019s best security for crypto and NFTs. But we also needed a fresh look to revolutionize your Web3 experience. That\u2019s why Tony Fadell, the iconic iPod and iPhone<em>*<\/em>\u00a0co-creator, teamed up with us.<\/p>\n<p>Ledger Stax\u00a0makes your crypto journey infinitely more intuitive. It is a credit-card-sized device enabling you to manage over 500 digital assets, your NFT collections and to explore an ever-growing range of Web3 apps through the Ledger Live app, connecting it to your smartphone via Bluetooth\u00ae**.<\/p>\n<p>Ledger Stax has a new E Ink\u00ae*** display, which covers the front and curves around the spine \u2013 you can view complete transaction details at a glance. E Ink is always viewable: your favorite NFTs art appears on the Ledger Stax screen, even when it is off. It also provides unmatched energy efficiency, so the battery can last for weeks or even months on one battery charge.<\/p>\n<p>Ledger Stax has integrated magnets, making them easily stackable, particularly for those who own multiple devices. The curved E Ink spine shows what\u2019s inside, like a book on a shelf.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith the Ledger Nano\u2122 series, we created the most successful digital asset security hardware wallet of all time \u2013 with more than 5 million sold and none ever hacked,\u201d says Pascal Gauthier, CEO and Chairman of Ledger. \u201cDigital assets are increasingly about identity and digital ownership, not just crypto like Bitcoin. The time is now for a device for more mainstream users. At the same time, we must not compromise on security. This is Ledger Stax\u2014secure and accessible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ledger Stax\u00a0uses secure USB-C to connect to the comprehensive Ledger Live\u2122 app on your laptop, and Bluetooth\u00ae to connect to the Ledger Live Mobile app on your smartphone. It will utilize Ledger Connect, our upcoming crypto wallet extension, to connect to Web3 apps from anywhere. Ledger Stax also supports wireless Qi charging.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDigging into Ledger\u2019s proven security technology and trying all the \u2018best\u2019 hardware wallets out there convinced me to build a next-gen device with Pascal, Ian and the amazing Ledger team,\u201d says Tony Fadell, designer of Ledger Stax and Principal at Build Collective. \u201cWe need a user-friendly\u2026no! A \u2018user-delightful\u2019 tool, to bring digital asset security to the rest of us, not just the geeks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The touch interface empowers Ledger\u2019s exceptional developer community to build innovative Web3 applications that are more accessible, with uncompromising security.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTony Fadell has both the circuit board and the billboard in mind when he builds a product,\u201d says Ian Rogers, Chief Experience Officer at Ledger. \u201cWith Ledger Stax we have made a device which is cool, beautiful, and fun. Together we have fused the uncompromising security and self-custody culture of Ledger, with the equally uncompromising user-experience-focused culture of Tony and his team. The result is the first true secure consumer hardware device for the revolution of value brought by blockchain technology.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWorking with Ledger is an incredible opportunity to be part of shaping how the world interacts with their crypto assets,\u201d says Benjamin Hubert \u2013 Founder, LAYER. \u201cWe strongly believe in a future of secure and private financial sovereignty where crypto becomes the norm.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To learn more, watch our podcast here:<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ledger Stax\u2122 is our new, breakthrough consumer device.
